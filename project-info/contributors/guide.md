# 🤝 Welcome to the Contributors Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **DevNotes**! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started, from our branching strategy and file structure to guidelines for creating consistent and high-quality content.

## 🗂 Repository Structure & Guidelines

Our repository is organized to make collaboration efficient and straightforward. To help you understand how content is structured, please refer to our documentation below:

- **[Folder Structure Guide](docs/FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md)**: Understand the layout of topics, subtopics, and how files are organized to maintain a clean and scalable format for our tutorials.
- **[Branching Strategy Guide](docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md)**: Learn about our Git branching model to ensure smooth collaboration and organized development flow.

## 🚀 Getting Started with Contributions

### 1. Fork & Clone the Repository
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/repo-name.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the repository:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```

### 2. Choose Your Branch
- **Main Branch**: Reserved for production-ready content only. Minimal direct contributions are accepted here.
- **Staging Branch**: All final changes from feature branches should be merged here for review before production.
- **Feature Branches**: Each major topic has a dedicated feature branch, e.g., `feature/cpp-tutorial`.
- **Feature Child Branches**: Individual contributors working on a specific subtopic within a feature should create child branches under the relevant feature branch, e.g., `feature/cpp-tutorial/hash-maps`.

*For detailed guidance, please review our [Branching Strategy Guide](docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md).*

### 3. Adhere to the Folder Structure
To keep content modular and consistent, follow our prescribed folder structure. Refer to the **[Folder Structure Guide](docs/FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md)** for a breakdown on where to place topics, subtopics, and accompanying files.

## ✍️ Content Creation Guidelines

### 1. Topic Structure
Each topic should follow a consistent format with clear sections:
- **Introduction**: Brief overview of the topic.
- **Key Concepts**: List essential definitions, terms, or foundational knowledge.
- **Implementation**: Show practical code examples or in-depth tutorials.
- **Interview Q&A**: Common interview questions related to the topic.
- **Practice Coding Problems**: Recommended problems for hands-on practice.
- **Sample Solutions**: Provide solutions with explanations for selected problems.

> *Example: [Hash Maps in C++](tutorials/cpp/hash-maps.md)*

### 2. Formatting & Style
To maintain readability and visual consistency:
- Use **Markdown headings** (##, ###) to structure sections.
- Add **code blocks** for all code snippets, specifying the language (e.g., `cpp`, `java`).
- Use **bullet points** or **tables** to organize lists and concepts.
- Adhere to our established [writing style and formatting standards](docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md).

## 📄 Submitting Your Contribution

1. **Commit Messages**: Use clear, concise commit messages, e.g., `Added introduction to Hash Maps for C++ Tutorial`.
2. **Push to Feature Branch**: Push your changes to the appropriate feature or child branch.
3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Submit a PR from your feature branch to the **staging branch** for review. Tag relevant reviewers to expedite the process.
4. **Review & Merge**: Once approved, your changes will be merged into the staging branch, and subsequently into main after the final checks.

*For more details on managing branches, refer to our [Branching Strategy Guide](docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md).*
